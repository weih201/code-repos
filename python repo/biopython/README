My name is Wei Han (weih 523979). Currently I'm a MIT student. In my previous studying, I've fiished the 7 subjects in MIT. The main programming language used in those subjects is Java. I also studied some declaraive programming such as Haskell and Mercury. But for the Python, I donb't have any experience, so the studing and practise Python is part of reason I selecting COMP90016 Computational Genomics subject.  

In this assignment3, I complted all the three stages of the assignment. The program file name and running command are same as the Assignment3 specification. I also submit a stage2.py file which is my assingment1 stage2 program used to process the output of this assignment.

The submit files also include a Interpretation.docx file. It should be open in the MS Office2007 or higher.
