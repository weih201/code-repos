## Python Repos
Some of my Python programs. Most of them came form my past course projects in University of Washington's "Introduction to Data Science", Brown University's "Exploring Neural Data" and Melbourne University's "Computational Genomics" courses. 

In: https://github.com/weih201/code-repos/tree/master/python%20repo/Sleep%20EEG%20data%20analysis%20and%20sleep%20stages%20predict , you can see an analysis about EEG sleep data with Python. It included the data exploratory analysis and sleep stages predicting classifier modelling.

https://github.com/weih201/code-repos/tree/master/python%20repo/Tweeter%20analysis includes some tweeter online analysis Python scripts.
