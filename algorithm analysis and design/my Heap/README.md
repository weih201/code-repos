## A Heap Implementation:

This part contains the Heap implemtation which used in other algorithms in this repos. It can perform following operations:

####  Insert an elem to Heap in log(n) time
####  Delete min or max in O(log(n)) time
####  Find min or max in O(1) time
####  Remove an elem based on its value in O(log(n)) time
####  Remove an elem based on its index in O(log(n)) time
