## The R repos

This repo contains some of my projects implemented with R. Most of them were course projects in JHU's "Data science specialization" via Coursera.

#### https://github.com/weih201/code-repos/tree/master/r%20repo/Data%20product%20developing/shinny%20project%20-%20pm25 :
This repo contains a shinny project which read the US's PM25 raw data, after the processing, display data into the US map. Besides shinny frame work, it also used the 'mapproj', 'maps','plyr' and 'ggplot2' packages.

#### https://github.com/weih201/code-repos/tree/master/r%20repo/Machine%20learning/Human%20activties%20predict%20based%20on%20data%20from%20accelerometers 
This is a machine leaning project which was to predict Human activities based on data from accelerometers. It was implemented in R Markdown form, based on 'caret', 'randomForest', 'gbm' and 'plyr' packages. After data clean and data modelling, the final model can have Cross-Validation accuray at 92%. For 20 predicting case which provided by project, the model has a 100% predicting accuracy.

In these repos, you can see some project about data visualization, data cleaning and statistics inference implemented with R.
