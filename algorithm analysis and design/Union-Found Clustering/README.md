##  Union-Found based clustering algorithm
This part implemented the max-spacing k-clustering problem with Union-Found algorithm.

For most graph, the normal union-found algorithm could work, this is implemented in clustering.py.
For a very large graph, a quick-union with path compression approach was implemented so the problem can be solved in reasonably time.
